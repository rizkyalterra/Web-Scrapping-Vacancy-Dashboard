The customers are the colleagues from the individual departments and areas across the entire site. A program needs to be quickly installed, a printer set up, hardware replaced or the user trained. Time is short and the individual is sometimes unnerved. It is important to remain calm, to work quickly and precisely with enthusiasm, to respond to the customer and to take their wishes and concerns into account. You can't know everything, but you know where to find what you don't know! However, you can only find a lot of things in English, so good knowledge is essential. So while you're inhaling and translating specialist literature, the phone rings and the chat flashes. Acute problems with the printer or weighing that must be resolved IMMEDIATELY. At the same time, the trainer is still waiting for the presentation for the next employee training and the documentation of the last installation. Anyone who doesn't know how to set priorities and organize themselves will get hopelessly bogged down. The tasks are clearly defined and the time frame is largely small projects that can be solved alone and independently or as a full member of the project team or department. True to the motto ""I'll only leave when everything is running smoothly!"" The workplace is the specialist department throughout the entire training.
