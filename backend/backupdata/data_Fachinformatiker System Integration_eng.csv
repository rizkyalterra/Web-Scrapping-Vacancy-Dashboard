We also do a lot for the team: regular events, sports activities at the locations and a top salary. The best thing: If everything works out for us (and we assume that), we definitely want to keep you after your training. We are looking for a trainee as an IT specialist, system integration (m/f/d) THIS IS WHAT YOUR TRAINING IS ABOUTPeople and technology - with that you always have something to do. As an IT specialist for system integration, you will, for example, help our lawyers with their IT issues (almost everything with a plug). Maybe an application is buggy, maybe a new notebook is needed. Do you always explain the latest smartphone features to your parents? These are the best conditions. And everyone is really happy when you get their problem under control. But you are never alone. Experienced colleagues are at your side, and an older trainee supports you as a mentor. At the same time, we would be happy if you got involved and researched solutions yourself. Very important: Without IT we don’t make any money. If the PC isn't running, our lawyers can get nervous and that can be stressful - don't let that upset you. At the same time, we always have the latest devices and software available. Speaking of “new”: whether system updates or cyber security, IT never stands still. Great if you feel like staying on the ball. And otherwise? Let's take care of you. We prepare you for exams and enable you to study abroad in the second year of your apprenticeship (if you like). We have our own offices in London and Brussels, and we are well connected in other European countries and around the world. With the other trainees (there are nine at the moment) we always go out together: brunch, cinema or something completely different. We also have team days (everything from climbing to geochaching to hut parties) and knowledge days on specialist topics in IT WHAT YOU BRING WITH YOU You can join us with a high school diploma or secondary school leaving certificate. DAX companies come to us for advice; it almost always involves a lot of money. Smartly dressed people in the hallway, business talk – okay with you? (Spoiler: In our team we are very relaxed.) English appears everywhere: with clients, colleagues or software. Great if you like the language. And we offer courses to support you. In IT we often work on weekends. As a trainee on a voluntary basis and with a bonus, delicious food and free time off. Okay for you? YOU CAN LOOK FORWARD TO THISOur trainees come to stay. If it suits both sides (and it almost always does), we will offer you a permanent position after your training. A happy IT team with 15 colleagues at the Stuttgart location. We usually spend our lunch break together and have something to laugh about every day. We also have our own academy: communication training, project management, Excel or Word – almost everything is available. A higher training salary than usual, 30 days of vacation (plus Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve), an employee portal with discounts for big brands, top connections, free parking, sports courses and so on.
